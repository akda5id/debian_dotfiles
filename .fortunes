Running has taught me that the pursuit of a passion matters more than the
passion itself. Immerse yourself in something deeply and with heartfelt
intensity - continually improve, never give up - this is fulfillment, this is
success.

If this life not be a real fight, in which something is eternally gained for
the universe by success, it is no better than a game of private theatrics from
which one may withdraw at will. But it feels like a real fight - as if there

The thought once occurred to me that if one wanted to crush and destroy a man
entirely, to mete out to him the most terrible punishment, one at which the
most fearsome murderer would tremble, shrinking from it in advance, all one
would have to do would be to make him do work that was completely and utterly
devoid of usefulness and meaning.

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your
systems. Your goal is your desired outcome. Your system is the collection
of daily habits that will get you there. This year, spend less time focusing
on outcomes and more time focusing on the habits that precede the results.
    -- James Clear

Our actions may be impeded ... but there can be no impeding our intentions or
dispositions. Because we can accomodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts
to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impedement to action
advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.

One should as a rule respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to

The Olympus Mons mountain on Mars is so tall and yet so gently sloped that,
were you suited and supplied correctly, ascending it would allow you to walk
most of the way to space. Mars has a big, puffy atmosphere, taller than ours,
but there’s barely anything to it at that level. 30 Pascals of pressure, which
is what we get in an industrial vacuum furnace here on Earth. You may as well
be in space. Imagine that. Imagine a world where you could quite literally
walk to space.

Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, 
to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of following 
my fancies as a butterfly, and was unconscious of my individuality as a man. 
Suddenly, I awake, and there I lay, myself again. Now I do not know whether 
I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly
dreaming that I am a man.
